# General installation manual for macOS

In contrast to the Windows installation, Mac users can still use VirtualBox for their virtual machines. A transition to VMWare is possible, but this is only with a paid license. Other non-free VM-software for macOS is Parallels Desktop.

## Requirements

* **Mac hardware must be a 2010 or a newer model**, with Intelâ€™s hardware support for memory management unit (MMU) virtualization, including Extended Page Tables (EPT) and Unrestricted Mode. You can check to see if your machine has this support by running the following command in a terminal: `sysctl kern.hv_support`. If your Mac supports the Hypervisor framework, the command prints `kern.hv_support: 1`
* **macOS must be version 10.13 or newer.** That is, Catalina, Mojave, or High Sierra. We recommend upgrading to the latest version of macOS. **NOTE**, once macOS 11 (Big Sur) is released, Catalina will not be supported anymore!
* At least 8 GB of RAM

## Git installation

1. Install git using the one of the options provided on [https://git-scm.com/download/mac](https://git-scm.com/download/mac). **Use the default settings of the git installer.**
2. Open your terminal and configure your username and email using the following commands.

```bash
# Run this inside the terminal with the correct email and name
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```

## Zoom installation
